# Objective
My research aims to model the dynamics of opioid misuse and use optimal control theory to inform strategic interventions, in particular digital education and prevention campaigns, to combat the opioid epidemic and reduce opioid-induced deaths. 

# Contents
model_0: SEIRP curves, R0 with respect to beta and gamma //
model_1: FBSA for quadratic control, FBSA for linear control, comparison between quadratic control/linear control/no intervention
